About this project

This is a simple buzzer circuit to act as an intermediary between full reel/scorebox assemblies and dry fencing.

TOOLS:

Soldering Iron
Solder
Wire Strippers
Wire cutters (to trim 'legs' after soldering pcb)

3D printer preferred to print enclosure parts.
	This can be outsourced:
		Some libraries have 3D printers available
		Local makerspaces have a surplus of printers that are accessible for a fee
		More and more, 3D printers are becoming a household device -- ask around, place an ad, etc.
		Dedicated 3D printing shops exist, and can produce parts at a reasonable cost

The enclosure is designed for an 8x6 hole footprint on 'standard'(?) PCB. 
Off-the shelf boards are cut using metal shears. 
Better methods probably exist.
